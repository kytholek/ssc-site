   Shown below the main reading when compound ≠ root
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

const COMPOUND_DESC = {
  10: 'The 10 carries the initiating force of 1 amplified to a new octave. Where 1 begins, 10 resets — it signals a clean slate arrived at through completion, not avoidance. The zero amplifies the 1\'s drive to near-absolute intensity. This compound belongs to those who seem to start from nothing and build everything, whose restarts are not failures but deliberate resets of the entire operating system.',
  12: 'The 12 holds the creative triad of 3 within a cooperative, service-oriented frame. The 1 pioneers; the 2 cooperates; together they form the teacher, the messenger, the bridge between self-expression and collective need. This compound tends toward sacrifice that doesn\'t feel like loss — a willingness to subordinate personal vision in service of something that reaches further.',
  13: 'The 13 is the transformer. It carries the 1\'s initiative and the 3\'s creativity, but reduces to the 4\'s discipline — meaning the creative impulse here is always asked to prove itself through work. Transformation is the theme: things that appear to end are actually changing form. This compound belongs to those who rebuild from rubble and find the new structure stronger than the original.',
  14: 'The 14 holds freedom and structure in creative tension. The 1 initiates, the 4 consolidates, and the root 5 demands full embodied presence — meaning this compound is always being tested by change. The lesson is that true freedom is built, not found. Discipline and adventure are not opposites here; they are the two legs of the same walk.',
  15: 'The 15 carries nurturing magnetic force. The 1\'s drive and the 5\'s aliveness combine to form the 6 root — meaning the mission of this compound is to care, but actively. Not passive service but pioneering love. These are the ones who create new forms of family, community, and care — who build the structures that hold others without becoming the structures themselves.',
  16: 'The 16 holds a difficult wisdom. The 1\'s ego-strength and the 6\'s love combine to form the 7 root — but the path runs through a particular lesson: the fall of what has been built on false foundations. This compound strips away what was constructed for the wrong reasons, making space for something built on genuine inner knowing. The destruction is the teaching.',
  17: 'The 17 is the star compound — spiritual aspiration meets practical authority. The 1\'s will and the 7\'s depth combine to form the 8 root — meaning the mission here is to build material power on a foundation of genuine spiritual knowing. This compound belongs to those who do not separate the inner and outer lives, who bring what they have discovered inward into the world in a form others can use.',
  18: 'The 18 holds the tension between personal ambition (1) and universal compassion (8/9). The compound reduces to 9, meaning all the authority and drive of the 1 and 8 must ultimately serve the whole. These are people who build power only to discover the power was never for them — it was the access point for a larger service.',
  19: 'The 19 is the prince of heaven who must learn through the fire of earth. The 1\'s independence and the 9\'s completion meet in a root 1 — but only after the lesson of interdependence is fully absorbed. This compound belongs to those who arrive at genuine self-reliance only after discovering they cannot do it alone. The ego is refined, not destroyed, through the encounter with the collective.',
  20: 'The 20 amplifies the 2\'s cooperative, receptive, bridge-building frequency to an absolute register. The zero doubles the sensitivity and the stakes. This compound belongs to those for whom relationship and partnership are not preferences but the actual vehicle of their purpose — those who build bridges between worlds, between people, between what is and what could be.',
  21: 'The 21 carries the creative communicator into the world. The 2\'s cooperation and the 1\'s initiative form the 3 root — but with a cooperative foundation, meaning the expression here serves connection rather than ego. The voice of the 21 is magnetic because it comes from a genuine desire to reach the other, not to perform.',
  23: 'The 23 is the royal star of the lion — a frequency of natural authority married to creative expression. The 2\'s attunement and the 3\'s joy combine through the 5 root to produce someone who moves easily through the world, adaptable and magnetically present, carrying the rare quality of being simultaneously royal and genuinely approachable.',
  24: 'The 24 builds love into permanent form. The 2\'s relational depth and the 4\'s constructive discipline combine to form the 6 root — meaning this compound is oriented toward creating lasting environments of genuine care. These are the builders of homes, communities, and organisations that carry a living warmth rather than mere structure.',
  25: 'The 25 seeks truth through experience. The 2\'s sensitivity and the 5\'s appetite for full embodied presence form the 7 root — meaning wisdom here is not theoretical. It is earned through relationship, through physical life, through allowing experience to become understanding. The inner life of the 25 is unusually rich precisely because the outer life has been lived fully.',
  26: 'The 26 carries material ambition in service of love. The 2\'s cooperation and the 6\'s nurturing combine to form the 8 root — meaning the drive for achievement here is not for personal accumulation but for the creation of environments where others can thrive. This compound builds power and uses it to care.',
  27: 'The 27 is a deeply spiritual compound — the combination of partnership (2) and inner seeking (7) forms the 9 root of universal service. These are people who have gone inward enough to bring something genuinely useful back. The wisdom of the 27 is intimate, not institutional. It arrives through the quieter rooms of direct experience.',
  28: 'The 28 holds material power and relational mastery in tension. The 2\'s attunement and the 8\'s authority combine to form the 1 root — meaning this compound ultimately must stand alone, having integrated the lessons of both deep partnership and genuine authority. Leadership here is not assumed but earned through the full experience of both receiving and commanding.',
  29: 'The 29 tests idealism. The 2\'s sensitivity and the 9\'s universal vision combine to form the 11 master number — meaning the emotional depth of this compound is not ordinary. These are people who carry visions so clear they are sometimes mistaken for demands, whose relational sensitivity is inseparable from their larger mission. The test is sustaining idealism through the difficulty of actual human contact.',
  30: 'The 30 is pure creative expression at full amplitude. The 3 at its most uninhibited, with the zero amplifying the frequency to its most essential register. This compound belongs to those who are here specifically to express — who suffer when the channel is blocked and flourish when the voice is free. The gift is original; the lesson is consistency.',
  31: 'The 31 applies creativity to practical construction. The 3\'s expressive power and the 1\'s initiating will combine to form the 4 root — meaning the creative impulse here is always being asked to build something real. These are the artists who also manage the studio, the writers who also build the platform, the visionaries who refuse to stop at the vision.',
  32: 'The 32 is a masterful communication compound. The 3\'s expression and the 2\'s cooperative sensitivity form the 5 root — meaning the communication here is not for performance but for genuine connection and movement. These are the voices that actually move people: teachers, speakers, writers who reach the specific nerve.',
  34: 'The 34 disciplines creativity into endurance. The 3\'s expressive flow and the 4\'s structural demand form the 7 root — meaning the creative work here runs deep, is refined over time, and arrives at the kind of insight that only sustained inquiry produces. Not prolific but precise — work that holds up under examination.',
  35: 'The 35 brings creative intelligence to the experience of full aliveness. The 3\'s expressive capacity and the 5\'s appetite for embodied freedom form the 8 root — meaning the creative power here can produce material results of genuine scale. These are people who make things with both artistic intelligence and commercial awareness.',
  36: 'The 36 carries visionary love. The 3\'s creative spirit and the 6\'s nurturing orientation combine to form the 9 root of universal service — meaning the creative work here is not private. It belongs to everyone. These are the artists, teachers, and voices whose work heals rather than merely entertains.',
  37: 'The 37 carries intuitive mastery. The 3\'s expressive gift and the 7\'s inner authority combine to form the 1 root — meaning this compound produces originals: those whose creative and intuitive capacities are so fused that what they make carries the unmistakable signature of direct inner knowing. Pioneers of the inner life who also make something visible.',
  38: 'The 38 holds the rare combination of creative expression (3), material power (8), and the master frequency of 11 as its root. The voice here is not merely communicative — it carries authority. The ideas are not merely interesting — they build. This compound belongs to those who are simultaneously the artist and the architect, the voice and the structure it speaks through.',
  39: 'The 39 carries creative completion. The 3\'s expression and the 9\'s universal orientation combine to form the 3 root again — meaning the creative gift here is entirely in service of the whole. These are the storytellers, artists, and voices whose work makes people feel less alone, whose expression carries the quality of something given rather than owned.',
  40: 'The 40 amplifies the 4\'s building frequency to an absolute register. Pure structural mastery — the capacity to organise, systematise, and build with total discipline. The zero doubles the dedication. This compound belongs to those for whom work is not a means but a calling, and whose patience with process is essentially limitless.',
  41: 'The 41 initiates structure. The 4\'s disciplined building and the 1\'s pioneering drive combine to form the 5 root — meaning the construction here eventually produces freedom. These are the builders who build toward liberation rather than containment, who create systems designed to make themselves unnecessary.',
  42: 'The 42 builds bridges. The 4\'s stable foundation and the 2\'s relational sensitivity combine to form the 6 root — meaning the construction here is always in service of relationship. These are the ones who build the infrastructure of connection: schools, families, organisations that function as genuine communities.',
  43: 'The 43 is the compound of practical creativity. The 4\'s structure and the 3\'s expression form the 7 root — meaning creative work here is disciplined to the point of mastery. The insight is not scattered but refined. These are people who practise their craft with the patience of the 4 and the love of the 3, and whose work eventually achieves a quality that could only come from time.',
  44: 'The 44 is a master compound — the supreme material builder. This frequency carries the weight of large-scale organisation, the mastery of physical reality, and the drive to construct systems that serve humanity across generations. The double 4 amplifies both the gift and the demand: the capacity to build at extraordinary scale and the requirement to do so with absolute integrity.',
  45: 'The 45 applies discipline to the experience of full aliveness. The 4\'s structural mastery and the 5\'s appetite for presence combine to form the 9 root — meaning the work of this compound ultimately serves the whole. The discipline is not for personal accumulation; it is for the development of a capacity that can be given away.',
  46: 'The 46 builds sustainable care. The 4\'s construction and the 6\'s nurturing combine to form the 1 root — meaning this compound ultimately produces something new in the world: environments, families, or organisations that did not exist before and that carry a living warmth. The new thing is always built carefully and loved into existence.',
  47: 'The 47 builds on inner authority. The 4\'s disciplined construction and the 7\'s depth of knowing combine to form the 11 master number — meaning this compound has access to a quality of spiritual intelligence that arrives through sustained inner work and rigorous building. What is constructed here is not merely functional; it transmits something.',
  48: 'The 48 combines structural mastery with absolute authority. The 4\'s building capacity and the 8\'s power orientation combine to form the 3 root — meaning what is built here ultimately becomes a voice, a platform, a creative legacy. The authority is earned through construction; the construction becomes a means of expression.',
  49: 'The 49 builds toward completion. The 4\'s patient construction and the 9\'s universal service combine to form the 4 root again — meaning this compound is in it for the long game. The work is methodical, deeply oriented toward serving something larger, and resistant to short-term thinking. These are the patient architects of genuine contribution.',
  50: 'The 50 amplifies the 5\'s aliveness and appetite for presence to an absolute register. The zero doubles the intensity of the freedom-seeking, experience-hungry, embodied quality of the 5. This compound belongs to those for whom half a life is not possible — who must be fully in or not at all, whose vitality is both their gift and the source of their most difficult lessons.',
  51: 'The 51 initiates into full presence. The 5\'s aliveness and the 1\'s pioneering will combine to form the 6 root — meaning the freedom-seeking here ultimately resolves into responsible love. The independence is real; the service is equally real. These are people who discover that the truest freedom is the freedom to give without resentment.',
  52: 'The 52 brings attunement to aliveness. The 5\'s dynamic presence and the 2\'s cooperative sensitivity combine to form the 7 root — meaning the full embodied experience of the 5 is constantly being integrated through the inner life of the 7. These are people who feel everything and understand most of it, whose inner world is as rich as their outer life is dynamic.',
  53: 'The 53 is dynamically expressive. The 5\'s aliveness and the 3\'s creative voice combine to form the 8 root — meaning the expression here has real material force. These are the performers, speakers, artists, and voices who do not merely entertain but compel — whose creative energy translates directly into results.',
  54: 'The 54 disciplines freedom. The 5\'s appetite for experience and the 4\'s structural mastery combine to form the 9 root of universal service — meaning the aliveness here is always being channelled toward something larger. These are the freedom-seekers who discover that the work itself is the freedom, that discipline is not a cage but a practice of presence.',
  55: 'The 55 is a master compound of freedom — double aliveness, doubled stakes. The master quality of the 55 means the frequency of full presence and embodied liberation is being carried at maximum intensity. These are people who are here to demonstrate, not describe, what complete aliveness looks like — whose lives are themselves the transmission.',
  56: 'The 56 brings aliveness to love. The 5\'s dynamic presence and the 6\'s nurturing care combine to form the 2 root — meaning the care here is alive rather than static, dynamic rather than dependent. These are the nurturers who stay interesting, whose love is both stable and surprising, who create environments that are simultaneously safe and fully alive.',
  57: 'The 57 combines full presence with deep inner knowing. The 5\'s embodied aliveness and the 7\'s inner authority combine to form the 3 root — meaning the wisdom here does not stay internal. It is expressed. These are people whose inner life is so rich that it naturally becomes art, teaching, or voice — who cannot help but give what they have found.',
  58: 'The 58 applies aliveness to material mastery. The 5\'s full presence and the 8\'s authority combine to form the 4 root — meaning the drive for material achievement here is grounded in direct experience. These are practical masters: people who know what works because they have lived it, whose authority is embodied rather than borrowed.',
  59: 'The 59 brings aliveness to completion. The 5\'s dynamic presence and the 9\'s universal orientation combine to form the 5 root again — meaning this compound is here to be fully alive in service of the whole, and then do it again. The cycle of experience and release is the pattern; the transmission is the full living of it.',
  60: 'The 60 amplifies the 6\'s nurturing, integrating frequency to its purest register. The zero doubles the love. This compound belongs to those for whom care is not an occasional act but a continuous quality of presence — whose entire orientation is toward the wholeness and wellbeing of those in their field.',
  61: 'The 61 initiates through love. The 6\'s nurturing orientation and the 1\'s pioneering drive combine to form the 7 root — meaning the care here is always searching, always going deeper, always asking what is really needed rather than what is comfortable to give. These are the bold carers: those who love enough to challenge as well as comfort.',
  62: 'The 62 integrates love and relationship at depth. The 6\'s care and the 2\'s cooperative sensitivity combine to form the 8 root — meaning the relational mastery here eventually produces genuine material authority. These are people who understand that the quality of their connections is their most important resource, and who build accordingly.',
  63: 'The 63 expresses love creatively. The 6\'s nurturing and the 3\'s creative voice combine to form the 9 root — meaning the creative work here is always in service of healing and wholeness. These are the artists, teachers, and voices whose work carries an inherent quality of care — whose expression itself is an act of love.',
  64: 'The 64 builds sustainable love. The 6\'s care and the 4\'s disciplined construction combine to form the 1 root — meaning the new things built here are always built to last and built with love. These are the patient constructors of genuine community: people who build not for recognition but because the thing needs to exist.',
  65: 'The 65 brings aliveness to care. The 6\'s nurturing and the 5\'s dynamic presence combine to form the 2 root — meaning the care here is alive and attentive, neither smothering nor distant. These are the nurturers who genuinely enjoy the ones they care for, whose love is expressed through presence and play as much as responsibility.',
  67: 'The 67 seeks wisdom in love. The 6\'s nurturing and the 7\'s inner authority combine to form the 4 root — meaning the care here is always seeking its own improvement. These are students of love: people who take relationship as seriously as any other discipline, who bring as much rigor to their connections as to their craft.',
  68: 'The 68 carries love and power in productive tension. The 6\'s nurturing and the 8\'s material authority combine to form the 5 root — meaning the integration of these two forces produces aliveness.

These are the true servants of humanity: those whose care has no agenda and whose generosity has no floor.',
  70: 'The 70 amplifies the 7\'s inner seeking and quiet authority to its absolute register. The zero doubles the depth of the inner life. This compound belongs to those who have gone further in than most people know is possible — whose inner world is vast, intricate, and largely invisible to others, but whose presence carries the unmistakable weight of someone who knows.',
  71: 'The 71 initiates from inner knowing. The 7\'s depth and the 1\'s pioneering drive combine to form the 8 root — meaning the authority here is built on genuine inner foundation.

The 7\'s depth and the 2\'s cooperative sensitivity combine to form the 9 root — meaning the inner knowing here is always being tested and refined through actual human connection. These are the wise ones who do not retreat from contact but use it as their most important teacher.',
  73: 'The 73 expresses deep knowing. The 7\'s inner authority and the 3\'s creative voice combine to form the 1 root — meaning what has been discovered inward is expressed outward, and the expression itself becomes a form of pioneering.

The 7\'s inner authority and the 4\'s disciplined construction combine to form the 2 root — meaning what is known inwardly becomes the foundation for structures that connect people.

  81: 'The 81 initiates from power. The 8\'s material authority and the 1\'s pioneering drive combine to form the 9 root of universal service — meaning all the power and drive here is ultimately in service of the collective. The achievement is real; the beneficiary is everyone. These are the leaders who build not for personal legacy but for what comes after them.',
  82: 'The 82 carries power into relationship. The 8\'s material authority and the 2\'s cooperative sensitivity combine to form the 1 root — meaning genuine self-mastery here is achieved through the discipline of real partnership.

The 8\'s material authority and the 3\'s expressive gift combine to form the 2 root — meaning the creative work here is built to connect, to reach, to bridge.

  84: 'The 84 disciplines power. The 8\'s material authority and the 4\'s structural mastery combine to form the 3 root — meaning the power here finds its most natural expression through creative building.

  85: 'The 85 applies power to full presence. The 8\'s material authority and the 5\'s dynamic aliveness combine to form the 4 root — meaning the power here must always be grounded.

  86: 'The 86 applies power to love. The 8\'s material authority and the 6\'s nurturing care combine to form the 5 root — meaning the integration of power and love produces genuine aliveness.

  87: 'The 87 applies power to inner authority. The 8\'s material mastery and the 7\'s depth of knowing combine to form the 6 root — meaning the power here is always checked against inner truth, and the inner truth is always translated into practical service. These are the wise leaders: those who know what they know and use what they have built in genuine service of others.',
  88: 'The 88 is a profound material mastery compound — double power, doubled responsibility. The double 8 amplifies both the capacity for achievement and the weight of the accountability that comes with it. These are people who carry an extraordinary ability to organise and manifest in the material world, and whose lives demand absolute integrity as the price of that power.',
  89: 'The 89 carries power to its completion. The 8\'s material authority and the 9\'s universal orientation combine to form the 8 root again — meaning the power here is always circling back to its source and asking whether it is being used rightly. The cycle of achievement and release is the pattern; the integrity of the use is the lesson.',
  90: 'The 90 amplifies the 9\'s universal service, completion, and compassion to an absolute register. The zero doubles the scope. This compound belongs to those for whom personal preference and collective service have become nearly indistinguishable — whose desire is to serve the whole, and whose lives are organised around that desire at every level.',
  91: 'The 91 initiates from completion. The 9\'s universal orientation and the 1\'s pioneering drive combine to form the 1 root — meaning the new things begun here are always informed by a vast perspective. These are the pioneers who have already lived many cycles and who begin again not from naivety but from the authority of someone who knows what is worth building.',
  92: 'The 92 brings universal compassion to relationship. The 9\'s completion and the 2\'s cooperative sensitivity combine to form the 2 root again — meaning the relational work here is entirely oriented toward genuine service and bridge-building. These are the mediators, peacemakers, and bridge-builders whose love has no preference for outcome.',
  93: 'The 93 expresses universal compassion creatively. The 9\'s universal orientation and the 3\'s creative voice combine to form the 3 root again — meaning the creative work here is an unmediated expression of universal love. These are the artists, teachers, and voices whose work has no agenda other than the transmission of what is most essentially true and most genuinely loving.',
  94: 'The 94 builds toward completion. The 9\'s universal service and the 4\'s disciplined construction combine to form the 4 root again — meaning this compound is here for the long work. Patient, universal, disciplined service. These are the ones who build the things that outlast them without needing to see the results.',
  95: 'The 95 brings aliveness to completion. The 9\'s universal orientation and the 5\'s dynamic presence combine to form the 5 root again — meaning this compound is here to be fully alive in service of the whole, moving through experience after experience, always remaining present, always releasing what has been lived. The transmission is the living itself.',
  96: 'The 96 is love at its most universal. The 9\'s completion and the 6\'s nurturing combine to form the 6 root again — meaning the care here has no preference, no agenda, and no limit. These are the great nurturers: those whose love is genuinely impersonal and therefore genuinely unlimited, who care for strangers as they care for the ones closest to them.',
  97: 'The 97 carries universal wisdom. The 9\'s universal orientation and the 7\'s inner authority combine to form the 7 root again — meaning this compound has completed many cycles of inner seeking and has arrived at something that feels less like knowledge and more like a quality of presence. The wisdom here is not held; it is embodied.',
  98: 'The 98 carries universal power. The 9\'s completion and the 8\'s material authority combine to form the 8 root again — meaning the power here has completed many cycles and arrived at something different from ordinary ambition.
